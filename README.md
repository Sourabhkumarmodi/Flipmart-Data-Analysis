# Flipmart-Data-Analysis
FlipMart data analysis: FlipMart data contains sales data, which is very similar to data from other e-commerce platforms like Flipkart. Before starting the analysis, we can perform ETL (extract, transform, and load). This involves extracting the data from Kaggle or other sources, transforming it (cleaning, removing duplicates, removing null values, and converting data types), and then loading it into Power BI for visualization. 
Data contains more then 50000 rows and 22 columns.
